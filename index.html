    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m a Mechanical Engineering graduate who loves turning ideas into real, working products. From redesigning roof-mounted solar collectors for my capstone project to building a DIY robotic arm prototype, I              enjoy taking concepts from design to tangible results. </p>

        <p>I’m particularly passionate about the space, nuclear, and aerospace fields, and I constantly seek opportunities to expand my skills in CAD, simulation, and programming. My projects reflect a hands-on                   approach to learning, where I combine creativity with analytical thinking to solve real-world problems.</p>

        <p>Beyond technical skills, I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy mentoring, leading small teams, and sharing knowledge—skills I’ve developed through both academic and personal experiences. I’m                 eager to contribute my abilities to meaningful engineering challenges while continuing to grow as a designer and problem-solver.</p>
