    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>
        The Spring-Powered Elevator Prototype focused on designing, fabricating, and testing a 
        <strong>purely mechanical system</strong> capable of climbing a vertical steel pole using 
        energy stored in a <strong>constant-force coil spring</strong>. Conducted as part of a 
        team-based mechanical engineering design course, performance was evaluated through a 
        competitive pole-climbing demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main goal was to create a <strong>lightweight, simple mechanism</strong> that could 
        climb a 7 ft (84 in) pole quickly and reliably while adhering to strict constraints on 
        materials, mass, and energy input. Only supplied materials were permitted, and no electrical 
        or motorized components were allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The final design used a <strong>wheel-based climbing mechanism</strong> driven by a 
        <strong>two-stage gear train</strong>, optimized to convert the spring’s limited energy into 
        sufficient torque at the drive roller. Components were modeled in SolidWorks and fabricated 
        using CNC machining and FDM 3D printing. Iterative refinements improved friction, weight, 
        and manufacturability.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the competition, the prototype climbed <strong>62 in (≈81% of the pole height)</strong> 
        in about 0.6 seconds, securing <strong>first place</strong> and being the only mechanism 
        to surpass the halfway mark. Total mass: <strong>169 g</strong>.

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

    <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>
    <p>
        Space elevators remain theoretical, but the challenge of efficiently climbing a vertical structure 
        has practical applications in <strong>inspection robotics, maintenance, and hazardous-environment automation</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A vertical steel pole served as an analogue for a space elevator cable. The challenge was to design 
        a <strong>purely mechanical climbing mechanism</strong> without motors, electronics, or external power sources.

    <h3>Project Context and Contributions</h3>
    <p>
        Completed over a single academic term, the project required all teams to work with the same limited 
        materials and compete in a timed climbing challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
        Individual contributions included: mechanical concept development, gear-train analysis, CAD modeling 
        in SolidWorks, CAM preparation, CNC machining, and iterative design refinement.

    <h2>Assumptions and Constraints</h2>

    <h3>Assumptions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Uniform surface properties along the steel pole</li>
        <li>Friction between drive roller and pole approximately constant</li>
        <li>Minimal but non-negligible energy losses from bearings and gear meshing</li>
        <li>Constant-force spring delivers nearly uniform output</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Design Constraints</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Only supplied materials permitted</li>
        <li>No motors, electronics, or external energy storage allowed</li>
        <li>Mechanism must remain intact throughout the climb</li>
        <li>Strict mass limitations</li>
        <li>Climb must be completed with a single spring release</li>
        <li>Design, fabrication, and testing confined to a single academic term</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design Methodology</h2>
    <p>
        A structured engineering design process guided the project: defining requirements, generating concepts, 
        evaluating options, and selecting the best design.
    </p>
    <p>
        Multiple concepts were considered, including inchworm-style mechanisms and braking-based climbers. 
        A wheel-driven design was selected for its <strong>continuous motion, simplicity, and favorable torque-to-speed characteristics</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Analytical calculations estimated torque, gear ratios, and expected climb performance, while CAD models 
        verified packaging, alignment, and manufacturability.

    <h2>Engineering Design and Implementation</h2>
    <p>
        The final prototype included a constant-force coil spring, two-stage spur gear train, primary drive roller, 
        and a lightweight structural frame.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gear ratios balanced torque and speed for sufficient traction with minimal energy loss. Most components 
        were CNC-machined from MDF, with select parts FDM 3D-printed. Bearings and shafts reduced friction and improved efficiency.

    <h2>Testing and Validation</h2>
    <p>
        Bench tests verified gear alignment, spring performance, and roller traction prior to competition. 
        Incremental testing addressed friction, structural weaknesses, and assembly tolerances.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the competition, the prototype climbed 62 in of the 84 in pole in approximately 0.6 seconds, 
        maintaining stability and structural integrity.

    <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
    <p>
        The prototype achieved the fastest climb and greatest height among all teams, demonstrating effective 
        conversion of limited spring energy into mechanical work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Limitations were mainly due to friction and finite spring energy. Further improvements could include 
        lighter materials, optimized gear profiles, and roller surface treatments.

    <h2>Conclusion and Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
        The project successfully demonstrated the design and fabrication of a high-performance, purely mechanical 
        climbing mechanism under strict material, mass, and time constraints. The prototype secured first place 
        and met all project requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Future work could explore alternative materials, improved friction management, and more efficient energy storage mechanisms.
