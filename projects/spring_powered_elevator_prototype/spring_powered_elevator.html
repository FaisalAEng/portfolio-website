    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>
        The Spring-Powered Elevator Prototype project focused on the design, fabrication,
        and testing of a purely mechanical system capable of climbing a vertical steel pole
        using energy stored in a constant-force coil spring. The project was conducted as part
        of a team-based mechanical engineering design course, with final performance evaluated
        through a competitive pole-climbing demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
        The primary objective was to develop a lightweight and mechanically simple device
        that could climb a 7 ft (84 in) vertical pole as quickly and reliably as possible while
        adhering to strict constraints on materials, mass, and type of energy input.
        No electrical or motorized components were permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
        The final prototype successfully climbed 62 in (≈81% of the pole height) in approximately
        0.6 seconds, achieving first place among all competing teams.
    </p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

    <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>
    <p>
        While full-scale space elevators remain theoretical, the engineering challenge of
        efficiently climbing a fixed vertical structure has practical relevance to inspection
        robots, maintenance systems, and hazardous-environment automation.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project used a vertical steel pole as an analogue for a space elevator cable.
        The challenge was to design a purely mechanical climbing mechanism without motors,
        electronics, or external power sources.
    </p>

    <h3>Project Context and Contributions</h3>
    <p>
        The project was completed as a team-based design exercise over a single academic term.
        All teams were provided with the same limited set of materials and evaluated during
        a timed competition.
    </p>
    <p>
        My contributions focused on mechanical concept development, gear-train analysis,
        CAD modeling in SolidWorks, CAM preparation, CNC machining, and iterative refinement
        based on testing and performance feedback.

    <h2>Assumptions and Constraints</h2>

    <h3>Assumptions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Uniform surface properties along the steel pole</li>
        <li>Constant friction between the drive roller and pole</li>
        <li>Minimal but non-negligible energy losses due to friction</li>
        <li>Approximately constant force output from the spring</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Design Constraints</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Only supplied materials permitted</li>
        <li>No motors, electronics, or electrical energy storage</li>
        <li>System must remain intact throughout the climb</li>
        <li>Strict mass limitations</li>
        <li>Single energy release from the spring</li>
        <li>Limited fabrication time and CNC access</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design Methodology</h2>
    <p>
        A structured engineering design process was followed, including requirements definition,
        concept generation, evaluation, and selection.
    </p>
    <p>
        Multiple concepts were considered, including inchworm-style mechanisms and braking-based
        climbers. A wheel-driven approach was selected due to its continuous motion capability,
        mechanical simplicity, and favorable torque-to-speed characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Analytical calculations were performed to estimate torque requirements, gear ratios,
        and expected climb performance. CAD models were used to validate packaging,
        alignment, and manufacturability prior to fabrication.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Engineering Design and Implementation</h2>
    <p>
        The final prototype consisted of a constant-force coil spring, a two-stage spur gear train,
        a primary drive roller, and a lightweight structural frame.
    </p>
    <p>
        The gear ratios were selected to balance torque output and rotational speed, ensuring
        sufficient traction while minimizing energy losses. Structural components were primarily
        CNC-machined from MDF, with select components fabricated using FDM 3D printing.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Testing and Validation</h2>
    <p>
        Bench testing verified gear alignment, spring performance, and roller traction prior
        to competition. Incremental testing identified frictional losses and structural issues.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the final competition, the prototype climbed 62 in of the 84 in pole in
        approximately 0.6 seconds, maintaining stable operation throughout the ascent.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
    <p>
        The prototype achieved the fastest climb and greatest height among all teams,
        demonstrating effective conversion of limited spring energy into mechanical work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Performance limitations were primarily attributed to frictional losses and finite
        spring energy. Further improvements could be achieved through lighter materials
        and optimized gear profiles.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Conclusion and Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
        This project demonstrated the successful design and fabrication of a high-performance,
        purely mechanical climbing mechanism under strict material, mass, and time constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
        Future work could explore alternative materials, improved friction management,
        and more efficient energy storage mechanisms.
