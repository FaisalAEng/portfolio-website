            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This capstone project investigated the design and thermal optimization of a building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) solar collector intended for residential heating applications. The project focused on recovering waste heat generated by photovoltaic panels while simultaneously reducing panel operating temperature to improve electrical efficiency.
            The system was evaluated through simulation-based airflow and heat transfer analysis, with emphasis on identifying passive, cost-effective enhancement strategies suitable for residential deployment. The work was completed as a team-based capstone design project, integrating principles of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and thermal system design.

        <section id="problem">
            <h2>Problem Definition & Context</h2>
            <p>Conventional photovoltaic systems convert only a fraction of incident solar energy into electricity, with the remainder dissipated as heat. Elevated panel temperatures reduce electrical efficiency and accelerate material degradation. At the same time, residential heating demand remains high, particularly in cold climates such as Ontario.
                Building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal systems offer a pathway to improve overall energy utilization by extracting thermal energy from PV panels. However, the effectiveness of heat recovery is strongly dependent on airflow behavior within the thermal duct beneath the panels. Poor airflow distribution and insufficient turbulence limit heat transfer and reduce system performance.
                </p>
        </section>

        <section id="system">
            <h2>System Description</h2>
            <p>The BIPV/T system consists of photovoltaic roof panels mounted above a sealed air channel. Outdoor air is drawn through the channel by a fan, allowing heat from the underside of the PV panels to be transferred to the airflow. The heated air may then be supplied directly for space heating or used as preheated intake air for an air-source heat pump.
                The air channel geometry, inlet configuration, and internal flow features are critical design parameters that govern airflow distribution, turbulence generation, and thermal performance.

        <section id="objectives">
            <h2>Engineering Objectives & Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase convective heat transfer between PV panels and airflow</li>
                <li>Maintain turbulent flow throughout the air channel</li>
                <li>Maximize outlet air temperature rise</li>
                <li>Avoid significant increases in airflow velocity or pressure loss</li>
                <li>Remain feasible for residential-scale implementation</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="design-concepts">
            <h2>Design Concepts Explored</h2>
            <p>Multiple airflow enhancement concepts were developed and evaluated:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Baseline configuration: No internal airflow enhancements</li>
                <li>Guiding wall concept: Redirected airflow to promote mixing</li>
                <li>Fin-based enhancement: Increased surface area and flow disruption</li>
                <li>Porous media (mesh) enhancement: Promoted uniform turbulence and mixing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each concept was simulated and compared using consistent boundary conditions to allow direct performance comparison.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="modeling">
            <h2>Modeling & Analysis Approach</h2>
            <p>A computational air-channel model was developed to analyze airflow patterns, Reynolds number distribution, and temperature rise along the duct length. Performance was evaluated using:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reynolds number as a measure of turbulence intensity</li>
                <li>Airflow velocity to assess flow restriction</li>
                <li>Temperature rise as the primary thermal performance metric</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The model enabled rapid iteration and comparison of design concepts within the constraints of the capstone timeframe.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="calculations">
            <h2>Key Calculations & Performance Metrics</h2>
            <p>Key analytical relationships included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reynolds number for internal flow characterization</li>
                <li>Energy balance relating mass flow rate, specific heat, and temperature rise</li>
                <li>Effective thermal transmittance to represent heat transfer from PV panels to airflow</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These calculations were used to support comparative evaluation rather than exact prediction of field performance.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="results">
            <h2>Results & Performance Evaluation</h2>
            <p>The final design combined fin baffles with a porous metal mesh distributed throughout the air channel. This configuration achieved:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sustained turbulent flow along the full duct length</li>
                <li>Outlet air temperature increases from approximately 0 °C to 8.66 °C</li>
                <li>Significantly higher Reynolds numbers than baseline and intermediate designs</li>
                <li>Improved heat extraction without increasing airflow velocity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Enhanced heat removal also contributes to improved PV electrical efficiency, which typically decreases by approximately 0.4% per °C increase in panel temperature.</p>

                <li>Porous media provided superior mixing but required consideration of pressure loss</li>
                <li>Fin geometry was selected to balance turbulence generation and manufacturability</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Design decisions prioritized performance gains that could realistically be implemented in residential systems.</p>
