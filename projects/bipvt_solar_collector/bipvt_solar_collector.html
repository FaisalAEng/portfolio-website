                This capstone project focused on designing and optimizing a building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) solar air collector for residential heating. The aim was to recover heat from PV panels while keeping their temperature lower to improve electricity generation.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Simulations and calculations guided the evaluation of passive, cost-effective design modifications such as airflow baffles and turbulence-enhancing features. The project applied principles of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and thermal system design within a collaborative, team-based capstone environment.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Multiple airflow enhancement concepts were explored to improve convective heat transfer and outlet air temperature. The final design demonstrates how modest changes to the air channel can efficiently extract thermal energy, benefiting both heating efficiency and PV performance.

            <h2>Problem Definition & Context</h2>

            <p>
                Residential heating in Ontario has historically relied on <strong>natural gas</strong> due to low fuel costs. Rising energy prices and climate targets are motivating low-carbon heating solutions.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels convert only part of the sun’s energy into electricity; the rest is lost as heat. Excess heat reduces PV efficiency and can degrade materials over time.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                <strong>BIPV/T systems</strong> recover heat from the underside of PV panels for space heating or as preheated intake for heat pumps. Effective thermal recovery requires well-distributed airflow and turbulence within the air channel.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Conventional air channels often have poor mixing and low turbulence, limiting heat recovery. This project addresses these challenges with <strong>passive, cost-effective airflow enhancements</strong>.
            </p>

        <section id="system">
            <h2>System Description</h2>
            <p>
                The BIPV/T system consists of <strong>PV panels mounted above a sealed air channel</strong>. Outdoor air flows through the channel, absorbing heat from the panel underside. The heated air can be used directly for space heating or as preheated intake for a heat pump.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Key components:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Air Channel:</strong> Guides airflow beneath PV panels.</li>
                <li><strong>Fan:</strong> Ensures consistent airflow.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancement Features:</strong> Passive baffles or porous mesh to promote turbulence and mixing.</li>
                <li><strong>Inlet & Outlet:</strong> Designed to improve uniform flow and pressure distribution.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>
                The system balances heat extraction efficiency with low airflow resistance, suitable for residential applications.
