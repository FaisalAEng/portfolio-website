                This capstone project focused on the design and thermal optimization of a building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) solar collector for residential heating. The goal was to recover waste heat from photovoltaic panels while lowering their operating temperature to enhance electrical efficiency.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                The system was analyzed using simulation-based airflow and heat transfer models, with an emphasis on passive, cost-effective enhancement strategies suitable for residential deployment. 
                The work was completed as a collaborative, team-based capstone project, applying principles of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and thermal system design.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                The project explored multiple airflow enhancement concepts to improve turbulence and convective heat transfer, ultimately evaluating their effectiveness in increasing outlet air temperature and sustaining turbulent flow within the air channel.

            <p>
                Overall, this project demonstrates how relatively simple design modifications can extract useful thermal energy from PV panels, improving both residential heating efficiency and PV electrical performance.

            <h2>Problem Definition & Context</h2>
            <p>
                Residential space heating in Ontario has historically relied on <strong>natural gas systems</strong> due to low fuel costs and established infrastructure. 
                Rising energy prices, carbon pricing, and stricter climate targets are increasing both the cost and environmental impact of fossil-fuel-based heating. 
                These trends motivate the development of <strong>low-carbon, energy-efficient residential heating solutions</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems convert only a fraction of incident solar radiation into electricity, with the remainder lost as heat. 
                Elevated PV panel temperatures reduce electrical output and accelerate material degradation. Waste heat is typically <em>dissipated to the environment</em> and underutilized.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) systems</strong> enable simultaneous electrical and thermal energy generation. 
                Heat extracted from the underside of PV panels can be used for space heating or as preheated intake air for an air-source heat pump. 
                Effective thermal recovery depends on airflow distribution and turbulence within the air channel.
            </p>
            <p>
                The core problem addressed in this project was limited convective heat transfer between the PV panel surface and airflow in conventional air-channel designs. 
                Insufficient turbulence and poor mixing restrict recoverable thermal energy. This project evaluated <strong>passive, cost-effective airflow enhancement strategies</strong> suitable for residential-scale implementation.

            <h2>System Description</h2>
            <p>
                The BIPV/T system consists of <strong>photovoltaic roof panels mounted above a sealed air channel</strong>. 
                Outdoor air is drawn through the channel by a fan, allowing heat from the underside of the PV panels to transfer to the airflow. 
                The heated air can be used <strong>directly for space heating</strong> or as <strong>preheated intake air for an air-source heat pump</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The air channel geometry, inlet configuration, and internal flow features are <strong>critical design parameters</strong> that govern airflow distribution, turbulence, and thermal performance. 
                Key components include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Air Channel:</strong> A narrow duct beneath the PV panels guiding airflow</li>
                <li><strong>Fan / Airflow Supply:</strong> Provides consistent flow through the channel</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancement Features:</strong> Passive modifications such as fin baffles or porous metal mesh to promote turbulence and mixing</li>
                <li><strong>Inlet & Outlet Configuration:</strong> Influences flow uniformity and pressure distribution</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The system is designed to <strong>maximize heat extraction without significantly increasing airflow velocity or pressure losses</strong>, suitable for residential-scale deployment.

            <h2>Engineering Objectives & Requirements</h2>
            <p>The BIPV/T system was designed with the following key objectives:</p>
            <ul>

                Passive airflow enhancements, such as fin baffles and porous media, were implemented to meet these objectives 
                while avoiding active control systems.
